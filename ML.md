### Generalization error  
**Definition**(Generlization error)
Given a hypothesis h ∈ H, a target concept c ∈ C, and an underlying distribution
D, the generalization error or risk of h is defined by

	
(2.1)
R(h) = Pr [h(x)  = c(x)] = E 1 h(x) = c(x) ,
x∼D
x∼D
where 1 ω is the indicator function of the event ω.
